# OD2WEIRT 
MCMC Algorithm for The Explanatory Two-way Outlier Detection Model

The goal of OD2WEIRT is to provide a MCMC routine for the Explanatory Two-way Outlier Detection Model.

## Example: Data Generation

This is an example showing how to simulate binary item response data including covariates.
